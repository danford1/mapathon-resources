# Resources for Mapathons

### What is a Mapathon?

The [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org/) project of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](http://hotosm.org/) curates events where volunteers can contribute to HOT tasks.

The Missing Maps group provides excellent resources for event organizers who are planning Mapathons:

Overview of resources: [http://www.missingmaps.org/host/](http://www.missingmaps.org/host/)

Detailed guide book: [http://www.missingmaps.org/assets/downloads/mapathon-materials/english/How_to_Host_a_Mapathon_EN.pdf](http://www.missingmaps.org/assets/downloads/mapathon-materials/english/How_to_Host_a_Mapathon_EN.pdf)

### One-page Guides
This repository aims to supplement these resources with a one-page guide that builds off of the Missing Maps table-top guide. The guide is structured to include additional tips and details related to the updated [Tasking Manager](tasks.hotosm.org) and is designed based on feedback from event participants.

Two versions of the one-page guide are provided:

1. A guide for general Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOTOSM) Missing Maps Mapathons
2. A guide for #HOTLunch events

### What is #HOTLunch?

\#HOTLunch is an initiative started by [Azavea](https://www.azavea.com/) to create a recurring volunteer opportunity for people around the world to contribute to HOT tasks. Volunteer your lunch break to map buildings, roads, and other features that NGOs use to plan aid efforts in response to natural disasters and humanitarian crises.

The idea is that collectively we can accomplish a ton by refactoring our lunch break into a volunteer time.
